# Link-in-Bio Webpage Project
This is my first project in GitHub Codespace where I can create a static website. 
# Project Overview
Link in Bio Webpage.
Create a static website using GitHub Codespace to serve as a personal "Link in Bio" page.
Using HTML, CSS, GitHub Codespace.
/ I do not use social media often, so I created links of things that I am interested in.//
